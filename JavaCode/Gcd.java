ğŸ§® Example:
- LCM of 4 and 5 is 20, because:- Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, ...
- Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, ...
- 20 is the first number that appears in both lists.


ğŸ“˜ Why Itâ€™s Useful:
- LCM is often used when adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators.
- It helps in solving problems involving repeating events or cycles.

Want to try calculating the LCM of a few numbers together? Or curious how it compares to GCD?
